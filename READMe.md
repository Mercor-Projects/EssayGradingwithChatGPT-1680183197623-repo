### Welcome to the Essay Grading with Chat GPT challenge! You will push your code here.

#### Description
**General Overview:**

The aim of this project is to use **GPT** or **Chat GPT** to grade essays. You will build a user interface that takes in an essay and then the website automatically grades the essay, highlighting areas where the essay is good, areas where it could be improved, and areas that need to be changed. The grading will be based on several parameters like grammar, structure, coherence, and relevance. You will use a GPT model through **Open AI’s** **API** to analyze the essay and provide feedback.



**Required Components:**

- User Interface: The user interface will be designed to allow users to input their essays. It should be easy to use and intuitive.
- GPT or chat GPT model: You will use GPT-3, Chat GPT, or GPT-4 to analyze the essay and provide feedback. The model will be fine-tuned on the specific task of grading essays.
- Grading Algorithm: You will develop a grading algorithm that considers several parameters like grammar, structure, coherence, and relevance. The algorithm will use GPT-3, Chat GPT, or GPT-4 to provide feedback on the essay.
- Feedback System: The website will provide feedback to the user on their essay, highlighting areas where the essay is good, areas where it could be improved, and areas that need to be changed. The feedback system will be designed to be clear and concise.

**Optional Components:**

- Customizable Grading Rubric: Users could have the option to choose a specific grading rubric to grade their essay, like a school's specific grading criteria.
- Natural Language Generation: The website could generate a report on the essay, providing a summary of the feedback provided and suggestions for improvement.
- Multiple Languages Support: The website could support multiple languages, allowing users to input essays in languages other than English and receive feedback in their chosen language.
- Incorporate Neural Machine Translation: The website could also incorporate neural machine translation to provide feedback on essays written in languages other than English.
- Interactive Practice Mode: The website could also include an interactive practice mode where users can submit a practice essay and receive immediate feedback.
